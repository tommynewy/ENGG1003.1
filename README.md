English Text Cipher Instructions:

Program operation selection:
    Edit the first character in operation.txt (no spaces or lines before) and use the below numbers to select the desiered operation
        (1) Rotation encryption
        (2) Rotation decryption
        (3) Substitution encryption
        (4) Substitution decryption

Key selection:
    Edit the first line of key.txt (with no spaces or lines before) and use the below instructions for rotation & substitution ciphers respectivley
        Rotation ciphers: a number from 0-25 (0 will produce no change in text) and no letters (any alphabet use will result in a key of 0)
        Substitution: a string of 26 capital letters, correlating to each letter to be substituted. (ie BCD... will substitute A for B, B for C etc.)
